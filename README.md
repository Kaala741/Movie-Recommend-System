# Movie Recommendation System

ðŸŽ¬ **Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System!**  
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. It recommends movies based on their similarity to a given movie, using features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

---

## **Features**
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends movies based on their similarity to a selected movie.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to include more features or datasets.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The system uses **cosine similarity** to compare movies based on their metadata (genres, keywords, cast, and crew).
2. When a user selects a movie, the system recommends the top 5 most similar movies.
